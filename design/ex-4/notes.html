    <header>Image Types and Use Cases:

    </header>
    <p>
        JPEG: Best for photographs or images with lots of colors and gradients. It uses lossy compression, which reduces file size but can lower quality.
PNG: Ideal for images that need transparency or sharp details, such as logos and icons. It uses lossless compression, maintaining high quality.
SVG: A vector format, great for scalable images like logos and icons. SVGs remain crisp and clear at any size and are often used for responsive web designs.

    <header>Basic Image Editing:

    </header>
    <p>
        Transparency: Removing the background from images (especially PNGs and SVGs) allows for better integration into designs without hard edges.
Compression: Reducing image file size without significantly compromising quality helps with page load times.
Resizing: Adjusting the dimensions of an image to fit different screen sizes or design elements ensures it loads faster and fits the layout properly.

    <header>Advanced Techniques:

    <p>
        Full-Bleed Images: These images stretch to the edge of the screen, often used in headers or backgrounds, creating a bold visual impact.
Placeholders: Used to show a temporary image or blurred version of a larger image while it is loading (especially useful for high-res images).
Responsive Images: Using techniques like the <picture> element and srcset, you can serve different image resolutions based on the userâ€™s device, improving load time and performance.
