    Color theory is a fundamental aspect of design, especially in web development. Here's a brief overview of key concepts related to color theory, CSS color formats, and how shadows, borders, and transparency can be applied:

<header>1. Color Theory</header>
<p>Color theory is a framework used to understand how colors work together in visual compositions. It includes concepts like color wheels, color schemes, and how different colors interact with one another.

    Color Wheel: A circle that shows the relationships between primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. The wheel is divided into 12 sections:
    
    Primary Colors: Red, blue, yellow.
    Secondary Colors: Green, orange, purple (created by mixing primary colors).
    Tertiary Colors: A mix of primary and secondary colors (e.g., red-orange, blue-green).
    Color Schemes:
    
    Monochromatic: Using one color in various shades and tints (lightened or darkened).
    Complementary: Using colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel (e.g., red and green, blue and orange). These create high contrast.
    Analogous: Using colors that are next to each other on the wheel (e.g., blue, blue-green, green).
    Triadic: Using three colors evenly spaced around the wheel (e.g., red, blue, yellow).
    Split-Complementary: A variation of complementary colors, but instead of one color and its direct opposite, you use the two colors adjacent to the complementary color.
    Tetradic: Four colors, forming a rectangle on the wheel (two complementary pairs).
    Warm vs. Cool Colors:
    
    Warm Colors: Red, orange, yellow. These create a sense of energy, warmth, and excitement.
    Cool Colors: Blue, green, purple. These are calming and soothing, often evoking a sense of peace or serenity.

<header>2. CSS Color Formats</header>
<p>CSS offers several ways to specify colors in web design. These include:

    Hexadecimal (Hex):
    
    A 6-digit code representing RGB values in base-16 (hex). For example, #FF5733 represents a shade of red-orange.
    Hex values can also include an alpha (transparency) channel: #FF5733A0 (where A0 is the alpha value in hex, ranging from 00 for fully transparent to FF for fully opaque).
    RGB (Red, Green, Blue):
    
    Colors are specified using three numbers representing red, green, and blue values, each ranging from 0 to 255. For example, rgb(255, 87, 51) represents a shade of red-orange.
    RGB with Alpha (RGBA) allows transparency to be specified. For example, rgba(255, 87, 51, 0.6) makes the color semi-transparent.
    HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness):
    
    Hue: The color itself, represented as a degree on the color wheel (0° to 360°).
    
    Saturation: The intensity or vibrancy of the color, where 0% is gray and 100% is the full color.
    
    Lightness: How light or dark the color is, with 0% being black, 100% being white, and 50% being the true color.
    
    For example, hsl(0, 100%, 50%) represents pure red.
    
    HSLA includes the alpha channel for transparency: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5).

<header>3. Shadows, Borders, and Transparency</header>
<p>Shadows:

    Box Shadow: Adds a shadow effect to an element’s border box. It takes values for horizontal and vertical offset, blur radius, spread radius, and color.
    Example: box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); creates a soft shadow.
    Text Shadow: Adds a shadow to text, often used for emphasizing text or creating effects.
    Example: text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);.
    Borders:
    
    Borders define the outline of an element. They can be styled in various ways, including solid, dashed, dotted, and with different colors.
    Example: border: 2px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); gives a subtle, light border.
    Transparency:
    
    Alpha Channel: CSS allows setting transparency using the rgba and hsla color models, where the a (alpha) value determines the opacity.
    The alpha value ranges from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).
    Transparency can also be applied using opacity property to an entire element, which affects its content and background.
    Example: opacity: 0.5; makes the element 50% transparent.
