    <header>1. Spacing Techniques
    </header>
    <p>
        Proper use of margins, padding, and whitespace helps create clear boundaries and avoid clutter.

Margins
Margins define space outside an element.
Use margins to separate unrelated elements and maintain consistent spacing between blocks of content.
Padding
Padding defines space inside an element.
Use padding to ensure content within a box (like text or images) does not touch the edges.
Whitespace
Whitespace (or negative space) is the unmarked space in your layout.
Generous whitespace between elements improves readability and focus.

    <header>2. Grid Systems
    </header>
    <p>
        CSS grids are powerful tools for creating structured and balanced layouts.

Use display: grid or display: flex to align elements.
Define grid areas for headers, sidebars, main content, and footers.
Add gap properties to maintain consistent spacing.
Grid Layout Benefits
Ensures alignment across the page.
Provides a scalable structure for responsiveness.
Example Grid Structure:

12-column layout: Commonly used for responsive design.
Auto-fit/auto-fill: Dynamically adjusts column count based on screen size.

    <header>3. Alignment and Consistency
    </header>
    <p>
        Alignment
Align text and elements (left, center, or right) consistently to create harmony.
Use CSS properties like text-align, justify-content, and align-items.
Consistency
Maintain consistent font sizes, colors, and spacing throughout the page.
Use CSS variables or design tokens for consistency (--primary-color, --base-spacing).
