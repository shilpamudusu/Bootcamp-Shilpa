    <header>Understanding Different Font Types
    </header>
    <p>Fonts are typically divided into several categories based on their characteristics. The three main types are serif, sans-serif, and monospace, but there are others as well. Let's explore each of these in detail:

        1. Serif Fonts
        Definition: Serif fonts have small lines or decorations at the end of their characters. These little "feet" or "tails" are known as serifs.
        Characteristics: These fonts tend to have a more traditional, formal, and classic feel. They are often used in print for long texts because the serifs help guide the readerâ€™s eyes across the page.
        Examples: Times New Roman, Georgia, Garamond
        Use Case: Best for printed material, books, newspapers, or when you want to convey a sense of tradition and authority.
