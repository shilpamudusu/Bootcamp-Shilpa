    <header>CSS units and responsive Design</header>
    <p>Part 1: Understand CSS Units
        Relative Units:
        
        em: Relative to the font size of the parent element.
        rem: Relative to the root element’s font size.
        ch: Relative to the width of the "0" character in the current font.
        %: Relative to the parent element’s dimensions.
        Viewport Units:
        
        vw: 1% of the width of the viewport.
        vh: 1% of the height of the viewport.
        vmin: The smaller of vw and vh.
        vmax: The larger of vw and vh.
        Modern Functions:
        
        min(): Chooses the smallest value.
        max(): Chooses the largest value.
        clamp(min, preferred, max): Restricts a value to a defined range.
        Part 2: The Task
        Create a simple webpage where:
        
        The header scales with the screen size using clamp().
        The main content uses em, rem, and % for sizing and spacing.
        The footer is positioned at the bottom using viewport units.
