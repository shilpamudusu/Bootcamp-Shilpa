    <div class="review-header">Project Overview</div>
    <div class="review-content">
      <p>Rohan’s project is an <strong>online recipe platform</strong> where users can browse, search, and filter recipes. It also allows users to create an account and save their favorite recipes.</p>

    <div class="review-header">Evaluation</div>
    <div class="review-content">
      <p><strong>Design:</strong> The design is clean and easy to navigate. It uses a neutral color scheme that does not distract from the content. However, the font sizes and button placements could be improved for better accessibility and usability on mobile devices.</p>
      <p><strong>Code Quality:</strong> The code is well-organized, and the use of modular components is commendable. There are some places where redundant code can be reduced, especially in CSS. Adding more comments and better naming conventions would improve code readability.</p>
      <p><strong>Usability:</strong> The application provides a good user experience, with an intuitive recipe search and filter functionality. However, some performance optimizations are needed, particularly for large recipe data sets. Implementing lazy loading for recipes would be a good improvement.</p>
