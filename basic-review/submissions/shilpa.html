    <div class="review-header">Project Overview</div>

    <div class="review-header">Evaluation</div>
    <div class="review-content">
      <p><strong>Design:</strong> The design is clear and easy to use. The user flow for booking tickets is smooth, and the use of a color palette adds an aesthetically pleasing touch. However, some sections could be optimized for smaller devices, especially the seating selection interface.</p>
      <p><strong>Code Quality:</strong> The code is well-structured, and the user interface is responsive. The functions are logically organized, though some parts of the CSS could be improved for consistency. Additionally, the error handling for invalid inputs can be better implemented.</p>
      <p><strong>Usability:</strong> The booking process works well and is intuitive. However, adding a payment gateway feature would complete the booking experience. Furthermore, an email confirmation system for ticket bookings would improve the functionality.</p>
