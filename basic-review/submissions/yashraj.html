    <div class="review-header">Project Overview</div>
    <div class="review-content">
      <p>Yashraj’s project is a <strong>personal portfolio website</strong> that showcases his skills, projects, and experience. The website has sections for an about me, contact form, and a list of projects with descriptions and links.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="review-header">Evaluation</div>
    <div class="review-content">
      <p><strong>Design:</strong> The design is simple but elegant, with clear typography and good use of whitespace. The color choices are balanced and appropriate. The portfolio is responsive, but some sections could benefit from more visual elements (e.g., icons or images) to make it more engaging.</p>
      <p><strong>Code Quality:</strong> The code is clean, but some parts could benefit from better modularization, especially in CSS. Additionally, the JavaScript code could use some optimization, particularly in handling form submissions and validation.</p>
      <p><strong>Usability:</strong> The website functions well, with smooth navigation between sections. However, the contact form could be improved with better form validation, error handling, and feedback for users submitting it. Accessibility can be improved by adding ARIA labels for certain elements.</p>
