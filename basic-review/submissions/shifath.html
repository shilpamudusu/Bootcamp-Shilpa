    <div class="review-header">Project Overview</div>
    <div class="review-content">
      <p>Shifath’s project is a <strong>blog platform</strong> where users can create, edit, and share blog posts. The project features a clean layout, rich text editor, and a commenting system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="review-header">Evaluation</div>
    <div class="review-content">
      <p><strong>Design:</strong> The design is modern and user-friendly, with a minimalist approach that enhances readability. The layout is well-organized, and the typography works well for longer posts. However, adding a darker background for the blog posts section could improve readability for some users.</p>
      <p><strong>Code Quality:</strong> The code is mostly clean, but the structure could be more modular, especially for the components and styles. A little more use of comments and documentation would make it easier to understand for future development.</p>
      <p><strong>Usability:</strong> The platform functions well, with smooth navigation between posts and user interactions. It’s intuitive, but there could be more interactive feedback like post submission confirmation, and better form validation would help prevent submission errors.</p>
