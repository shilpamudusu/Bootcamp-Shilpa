    <div class="review-header">Project Overview</div>
    <div class="review-content">
      <p>Soniaâ€™s project is an <strong>online job portal</strong> where users can create profiles, browse job listings, and apply for jobs.</p>

    <div class="review-header">Evaluation</div>
    <div class="review-content">
      <p><strong>Design:</strong> The design is simple and clear, with a focus on job listings and profile management. However, the color scheme could be more vibrant to engage users better. The user interface is a bit sparse, and adding more icons or imagery would improve the overall look.</p>
      <p><strong>Code Quality:</strong> The code is straightforward and functional, but some parts could benefit from better organization and optimization, particularly in the CSS files.</p>
      <p><strong>Usability:</strong> The website is user-friendly, allowing easy navigation between profiles and job listings. However, adding a filter option for job search and more detailed job descriptions would enhance the usability further.</p>
