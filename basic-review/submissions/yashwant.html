    <div class="review-header">Project Overview</div>
    <div class="review-content">
      <p>Yashwant’s project is a <strong>task management application</strong> designed to help users track and organize their daily tasks effectively. The project features user login, task creation, and task management functionalities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="review-header">Evaluation</div>
    <div class="review-content">
      <p><strong>Design:</strong> The design is clean and well-organized, with easy navigation between task management features. The color scheme is consistent, though the contrast between the background and text could be improved for better readability. Mobile responsiveness is good, but the button sizes could be optimized for smaller screens.</p>
      <p><strong>Code Quality:</strong> The code is well-structured with proper use of modularity. It uses modern JavaScript techniques, and functions are defined clearly. There is room for improvement in optimizing some repetitive CSS code. Additionally, adding comments would help in understanding the logic behind certain sections of the project.</p>
      <p><strong>Usability:</strong> The app is fully functional with easy task creation and management. However, some feedback mechanisms, such as form validation or confirmation messages, would enhance user experience. There’s also room for accessibility improvements like adding alt text to images and improving form labels.</p>
