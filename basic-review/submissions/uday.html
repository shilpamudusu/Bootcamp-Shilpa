    <div class="review-header">Project Overview</div>
    <div class="review-content">
      <p>Uday Kumarâ€™s project is a <strong>personalized movie recommendation system</strong> where users can view movies, filter them by genre, and get recommendations based on their preferences.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="review-header">Evaluation</div>
    <div class="review-content">
      <p><strong>Design:</strong> The design is clean and minimal, allowing users to focus on the content. However, it could benefit from more engaging visuals, such as posters or thumbnails for the movies, to make it visually appealing.</p>
      <p><strong>Code Quality:</strong> The code is well-structured, with proper use of functions and modularization. The API integration is smooth, but the handling of edge cases could be improved. Adding comments and documentation would also help others understand the logic behind the code.</p>
      <p><strong>Usability:</strong> The recommendation feature is useful, but it could be more intuitive. The filtering options are good, but a search feature to directly search for movies would add more flexibility to the app.</p>
