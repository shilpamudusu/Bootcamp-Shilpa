    <h2>Abhijeet A S</h2>
    <div class="review-header">Project Overview</div>
    <div class="review-content">
      <p>Abhijeet’s project is a comprehensive <strong>e-commerce platform</strong> designed to facilitate online shopping with product listings, a shopping cart, and user authentication. The project demonstrates good use of front-end technologies, with a focus on clean UI and user engagement.</p>

    <div class="review-content">
      <p><strong>Design:</strong> The design is visually appealing with a clean and modern interface. The layout is intuitive, and the color scheme is consistent throughout. However, some small elements, such as button hover states and icon spacing, can be further refined for a more polished user experience. Additionally, the mobile responsiveness can be improved, as some content overlaps on smaller screens.</p>
      <p><strong>Code Quality:</strong> The code is well-structured with clear variable names and functions. The use of modern HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript features is evident, and the project structure is easy to navigate. A suggestion would be to modularize the CSS further for easier maintenance, and comments could be added for clarity, especially for more complex code sections.</p>
      <p><strong>Usability:</strong> The project works as expected with all primary functionalities intact. Navigation between pages is smooth, and product interactions are intuitive. It would benefit from additional feedback elements, such as form validation on user inputs or loading indicators when content is fetching. Accessibility could also be improved by adding alt text for images and ensuring color contrast for visually impaired users.</p>
