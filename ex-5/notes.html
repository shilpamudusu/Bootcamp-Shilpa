            Explanation
Grid Layout:

grid-template-areas defines sections:
"header header": Header spans across two columns.
"sidebar main": Sidebar and main content sit side by side.
"footer footer": Footer spans across two columns.
grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns define the size of rows and columns:
minmax(200px, 1fr) ensures the sidebar is at least 200px wide but can expand proportionally.
2fr makes the main content area twice as wide as the sidebar.
Overflow Handling:

overflow-y: auto in the sidebar and main content ensures scrollable content without breaking the layout.
Responsive Design:

A media query adjusts the grid for screens narrower than 768px:
The layout becomes a single-column stack with grid-template-areas reordered for mobile readability.
One-Line Layout Inspiration:

The minmax() function, combined with flexible grid areas, creates a layout that adapts to content and screen sizes dynamically.
