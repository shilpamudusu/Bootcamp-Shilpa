    <header>1. Basics of HTML
<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web development. It structures content on a web page using elements enclosed in tags, like <html>, <body>, and <p>. Key concepts include:

    Elements: Fundamental building blocks of HTML, e.g., <div>, <h1>, <p>.
    Attributes: Provide additional information about elements, e.g., <a href="url">Link</a>.
    Document Structure: HTML documents begin with <!DOCTYPE html>, followed by <html>, <head>, and <body>.
    </p>    </header>

    <article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content.
    <section>: Defines sections of content.
    <footer>: Marks the footer for a page or section.
    These elements help browsers, developers, and search engines understand the structure and purpose of your web content.
    
    </p>    </header>

    <header>: Wraps introductory content or navigational links for a document or section.
    <meta>: Provides metadata, such as the character set or viewport settings, within the <head>.
